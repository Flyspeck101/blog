# Tetris openers that I use 
_30/05/2022_

Yay! First blog post. Things will either go uphill, downhill, or just hill. 

Ok

I know a lot of openers. This is because I look at the Hard Drop Wiki. I am, however, not in the Hard Drop Discord server, as I have seen how people talk in the wiki and I do not believe that the noble muffin race would be accepted there. It seems like it isn't a very good community. But I digress. 

As I said, I know a lot of openers. 

Openers I know, but do not use:
- Mr T-Spin's STD 
- Albatross 
- Pelican 
- Number One 
- BT Cannon 
- DT Cannon (I actually used to use this but then I developed my own opener because I didn't like the high stack of DT) 
- 4W, 3res and 6res 
- Amogus 

And I probably forgot a few but eh
who cares 

Openers that I actually use: 
- TKI Flat/Castle 
- SDPC
- Stickspin (when I get sent garbage super early)
-
