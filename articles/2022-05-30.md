# Tetris openers that I use 
_30/05/2022_

Yay! First blog post. Things will either go uphill, downhill, or just hill. 

Ok

I know a lot of openers. This is because I look at the Hard Drop Wiki. 

It is a very big wiki 

As I said, I know a lot of openers. 

### Openers I know, but do not use:
- Mr T-Spin's STD 
- Albatross 
- Pelican 
- Number One 
- BT Cannon 
- DT Cannon (I actually used to use this but then I developed my own opener because I didn't like the high stack of DT) \
- MKO
- 4W, 3res and 6res 
- Amogus 

And I probably forgot a few but eh
who cares 

Hmm, I should learn Godspin. 

### Openers that I actually use: 
- TKI Flat/Castle (I try to go Flat, but Castle Top TKI is better than no TKI)
- SDPC
- Stickspin (when I get sent garbage super early)
- My own opener, [MuffSpin](https://fumen.zui.jp/?v115@AhBtDewhQ4CeBtglRpwhR4Aei0glRpwhAeQ4Ceg0hl?AewhJeAgHvhBFlBAAAUhBtDeQ4AewhCeglh0AeQ4JeAAA7g?hlwhAeAtRpDeglwhBtRpAeR4AeglwhAtg0BeR4CewhAei0O?eAAPYAKoo2AiIHNEy488AwW88AwBRoDFbUEDPhwwHexwIew?wKeAAAvhAAAAPhh0Q4AeAtxwDeg0Q4BtxwAexhQpg0JeAAA?egwhIewhHeglwhDeh0BeglwhAtAeRpg0CehlBtRpg0AeR4C?eAtEeR4UeAAAegQaRegWBeilDegWBeglFegWQaneAAAagAt?HeBtCeQawhCeAtDeQawhiWDeQpglwSgWxSDeQpglwSgWRaG?egWbeAAAvhBtrBAAA4gAtHeBtDeQ4CeAtEeQ4CehlBexwQ4?CeglCexwJeAAAngglIeglBeR4whDehlR4AtwhDeRpAeBtwh?Ceg0RpAeAtwwwhCeg0CeywBeh0LeAAAHgQ4IeR4BeilDeQ4?ilAtRph0Aewhg0glBtRpg0Bewhg0glAtxhQ4g0Bewhh0xhA?tQ4CewhxwAeBtQ4CeglxwAeAtQpQ4CeglCeSpBehlLedYBv?hBdnBAAApgwhIewhGehlwhBeRpAewDBeglwhAtAeRpDeilA?tB8R4wDgWg0APAeiWA8BeAAKeAAPaA6viSASIc5DU988AwN?88AwB/dEFM98AQXBAAvhBdtBAAA9gQ4IeQ4Geh0Q4BexwDe?g0Q4AtAexwAexhQpg0JeAAA3gh0FeRpg0FeQ4Rpg0AeBtCe?R4DeBtCeQ4QeAAA1gglIeQawSHeRajeAAAjgglIeglFewhg?WQ4BPEewhgWQ4whFegHBtwhFegHQaIeQaQeAAAvhBtrBAAA?Bhg0Ieg0FeQ4Aewhh0EeQ4AexhOeAAA9gh0Gewhg0DeBthl?whg0EeBtglwhHeglwhJeFlBvhAAAApgRpHeRpFehlwhg0Ge?glwhi0BeR4AeglQLgWAtA8AeR4BeQ4wDAeAtAPAAC8gWQ4J?eAAPbA6viSASIc5DU988AwN88AQzsuDPMVTAS4CCAvhBdtB?AAAzgxwHexwFeh0Q4glGeg0Q4ilBexhQpg0Q4AeBtDeQpKe?AAArgg0Iei0GeRpHeRpAezheeAAAsgh0GeAPgHHeQawSHeR?ajeAAAigQ4HegHxhGegWg0whGegWg0HeBtjeAAAigwDIewD?wSGeglgWwSGeglgWHeBPjeNrBvhAAAA0gi0DehlwhRpg0Ee?glwhRpAeAPAeR4AeglwDAPglBtR4BeA8wDAeglBeC8AAKeA?APDAanfBAvhBdtBAAA+gilDeh0Q4xwglEeg0Q4xwCexhQpg?0Q4AeBtDeQpKeAAAvhBdrBAAA3gh0DeilAeg0EeglCeg0Ae?BtFeQpBeBtDeRpOeAAAvhBtrBAAAUhA8glgHCeA8gWg0gWA?egHC8AeA8JeAAP3APoo2AiIHNEy488AQn88AwBRoDFbUOCF?bcsAlsLSAS4PMEFbMwDv3STAS4FNEMjboEVp8CA)
-  PCO 

Why do I use these openers? 
- TKI - I mean, it's TKI. What more can I say? 
- SDPC - Good opener with good followups, also it's funny 
- Stickspin - stop the hate against Stickspin. It's a good opener, just don't crutch on it. Simple. Good followups, like DT Cannon or floating T-Spin. 
- Muffspin - I'd rather use this than DT Cannon. I mean, there are some problematic second bags, that's a definite downside. But it's got good continuations in the main setup. 
- PCO - Good opener with good continuations. Kaidan continuation is my personal favourite. 

## Why not DT Cannon? 
To be honest with ya, I feel like DT is overrated. It certainly is good, but it's a bit of a high stack. One perfect clear tops you out. It's a great opener for around B to S- rank, but... beyond that, other openers are better. 

### Why DT is good 
- It's one of the fastest openers to build, taking a total of 12 taps to complete. 
- It sends 12 lines if you spike. 
- It has good continuations. 

### And why I don't use it 
- **It's a high stack.** It takes up like seven rows. That means that anything that sends more than 10 lines is going to cause you serious trouble. 
- **It wastes T.** Not too bad considering how it often takes around the same time to build three bags of DT as it does two bags of SDPC, but still. 
- **It doesn't send garbage within the first bag.** This is also why I prefer other openers to PCO, which I haven't said but I will soon. 

## How I choose which opener to do 

This is easy. 
If I can TKI, then I TKI. Otherwise: 

EARLY O - SDPC/Stickspin 
EARLY LJ - Muffspin 
Otherwise PCO. 

I prefer Muffspin over SDPC, as if my opponent is doing SDPC then I will ruin the PC. Also, Even if they use, say, SDPC spin, I can still send the same amount of garbage. 

Okay, you prabably saw the Fumen where I showed MuffSpin. The main continuation wasn't accurate. 
[Here's what I usually do.](https://fumen.zui.jp/?v115@vhAAgHAhBtDewhQ4CeBtglRpwhR4Aei0glRpwhAeQ4?Ceg0hlAewhJeAAAvhBFlBAAAUhBtDeQ4AewhCeglh0AeQ4J?eAAA7ghlwhAeAtRpDeglwhBtRpAeR4AeglwhAtg0BeR4Cew?hAei0OeAAAvhBdtBAAAPhh0Q4AeAtxwDeg0Q4BtxwAexhQp?g0JeAAAegwhIewhHeglwhDeh0BeglwhQ4AeRpg0CehlR4Rp?g0AeBtCeQ4EeBtUeAAAvhBtrBAAA8gQ4IeQ4Heg0Q4DehlB?eg0Q4whAexwglCeh0JeAAAvgAtHeBtEeQ4BeAtFeR4i0FeQ?4Beg0glGeilLeAAPKANo+1DP388AwZAAAvgAPHeBPAeAtFe?APAeBtHeAtfeAAPKANo+1DP388AQbAAAvhAlpQAACgI8AeI?8AeI8AeI8AeI8AeI8AeI8AeG8CeA8AeD8DeA8ReAAPpA0Lk?JEzuW5DPG98AwNReEvoo2AwjwRASIiXEFbU9A3oo2AjHfhD?PBAAACgIAAeIAAeIAAeIAAeIAA8EeDAA8EeAPCAA8DeBPAA?APAeQpQLCeAPAABPAeQpQLEeAPLeAAPXA0LkJEzuW5DPG98?AwNReEvoo2A3zoAA)

Now I'm tired and can't think of anything to conclude with, so until next time, stay happy, and try not to die, because that would be bad.
