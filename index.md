# Flyspeck101's Blog (for things)

Hello! welcome to my blog. This blog is mainly for things to do with [Tetris](https://www.tetris.com), a well-known game, and [BattleTabs](https://www.battletabs.io), not a well-known game but fun nevertheless.

Before reading any articles on this blog, you should know two things: 

1. It is hard to make this look like a proper blog with MD and my limited time, so be aware that most of these pages will likely look just like simple webpages. 
2. I am a muffin. Please consider my capability before criticising me unnecessarily.
